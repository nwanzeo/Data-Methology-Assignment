# IBM Data Science Methodology
Peer-graded Assignment: Final Assignment.


### Topic to apply data science methodology: Email.

This is due to my current role, in my organisation, which include managing the corporate email system. 


### 1. Business Understanding

XYZ Company uses a form on their website to generate leads for marketing purposes. However, a lot of the emails received using the form turn out to be spam. This generated false leads and degraded the quality of data collected by the email system. The company wants to automatically filter out spams; in order to focus on actual leads.  

Thus, how do we automatically identify spam emails and move it to the spam folder? 

Looking at some of the emails, we found that they all have the same subject, "feedback form". This is because they all came from the same online form. Consequently, we cannot determine whether a mail is spam or not using the email subject. However, the body of the emails revealed that most of the spam messages contain words like; Act Now, Buy, 
Click here, Order now, free, Unsubscribe, Visit our website, etc. It became apparent that if a mail contains one or more of the above words, it is most likely a spam email!


### 2. Analytic Approach
